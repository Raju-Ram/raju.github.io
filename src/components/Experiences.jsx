        <p> “I have spent five years as an executive assistant with Wiler, Inc. in administrative support roles.<br></br> As the current executive assistant to the CFO, I frequently collaborate with other administrative assistants to perform calendar management, coordinate international travel and assemble research reports for the financial specialists in our six offices around the world. At the beginning of last year, I optimized our email filtering system to improve office communication and reduce the amount of missed messages by 28%. I understand that your company depends a lot on email communication, so I want to use my organizational abilities to achieve faster communication processes in this office.”</p>
